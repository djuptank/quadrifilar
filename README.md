## Quadrifilar Helical Antenna Project

The idea with this project is to be able to simulate an antenna, then print working version that is within 1% of simulated frequency.

The design is ongoing and the journey is described in 
[QFA antenna](https://sa0pej.wordpress.com/qfa-antenna/) 
in blog [Electromagnetic Adventures](https://sa0pej.wordpress.com).

Contributions are welcome, this is not an easy project.

At the moment the predictions are 0.4% away from actual
measured resonance frequency. More testing needed. 

Antenna will work - at some frequency :-)
